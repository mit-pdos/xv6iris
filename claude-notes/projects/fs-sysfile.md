# fs-sysfile — the syscall layer campaign (file.c's last 2 + sysfile.c's 11)

OPENED 2026-08-11, immediately after the fs-namei campaign closed fs.c
at 24/24 (final gate green, 1001 vo, coverage 163/188 = 87%).
User-standing instruction: run this campaign, then shut the EC2 box
down. Targets: filewrite (308B) + filestat (98B) in file.c, then
sysfile.c's create (312B), sys_read (72B), sys_write (72B), sys_fstat
(58B), sys_open (342B), sys_link (254B), sys_unlink (384B), sys_mkdir
(72B), sys_mknod (96B), sys_chdir (128B). sys_exec (268B) is DEFERRED
to the exec campaign (its tail is kexec, 860B untouched). After this
campaign file.c is 7/7 and sysfile.c is 15/16 (sys_exec pending).

## THE INHERITANCE (the fs-namei close-out's 8 items, restated as work)

1. **ialloc's payout is raw**: `inode_ref kslot q dev inum` +
   `inum < 16*nib`; create builds `inode_held` itself (it owns the
   device ties); `dn' = ialloc_fresh ty` is documentation — ilock's
   THIRD FILL ARM (§16.5) is what actually hands create the fresh
   record.
2. **dirlink's short-write holes** (§15.1(i)): on the kernel arm
   either_copyin cannot fail, so the honest fix is `dist = 0` —
   strengthen SpecWritei's kernel arm, then re-derive SpecDirlink's
   third arm's range clause. Without it create cannot re-park its
   directory (`dir_ok` underivable on the middle-slot arm).
   **DONE in S2.**
3. **The linked-inum range premise** is missing from SpecDirlink
   (the existing one is the DIRECTORY's inum); the writer-side dir_ok
   proof adds `bv_unsigned inum < 16*nib` for the linked child.
   **DONE in S2.**
4. **The stat hole**: SpecStati.stat_at omits bytes 12..15; filestat
   owns them separately to copyout all 24.
5. **The fd-type fact**: FileInv's payload is `inode_ref` only on
   FD_INODE/FD_DEVICE; `f->off` is NOT zero for FD_PIPE/FD_DEVICE
   (sys_open only assigns it on the inode path). filewrite's contract
   needs the type discipline sys_open maintains.
6. **The 35-slot boot accounting** and **SpecFsinit's image premises**
   (incl. `hdr_n bs_hdr = 0`) are the BOOT CLIENT's, not this
   campaign's — listed so nobody re-threads them here.
7. **Two standing threaded obligations**: panic_wp_any (resource) and
   printk_gen_contract (Prop, two deep via ireclaim) — sysfile
   functions that reach them thread them the same way.
8. **fileclose leaks one iref_slot per closed inode file** (recorded
   pre-campaign) — sys_close's cone may want the per-ofile descriptor
   ghost SpecFileclose's header owes; scope at S0-stage per function,
   do NOT fix ambiently.

## S1 — the decode layer LANDED (13 Code files, all 32 shards)

Full-generator-into-scratch recipe: the baseline run reproduced all 188
generated files BYTE-IDENTICALLY, and the run with the 13 new manifest
rows left the 155 sibling Code files + the facade byte-identical, added
13 files, and touched the 32 shards as PURE ADDITIONS (+394 lemmas,
+1970 lines, zero removed lines, zero lost lemmas). No AST head form new
to the layer appeared; the single new `SHIFTIWOP` (in filestat) picked
`decode_bridge_ms_bv` correctly, so the durable-notes sraiw trap did not
fire.

| file | symbol | addr | size | instrs | prefix | width |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CodeFilewrite.v  | filewrite  | 0x80004258 | 308 | 118 | `fwri_`  | 3 |
| CodeFilestat.v   | filestat   | 0x80004132 |  98 |  40 | `fsti_`  | 2 |
| CodeCreate.v     | create     | 0x80004ab2 | 312 | 111 | `cri_`   | 3 |
| CodeSysRead.v    | sys_read   | 0x80004c36 |  72 |  25 | `sri_`   | 2 |

Width follows the documented rule (`3` at or above 256 bytes) — note
sys_link at 254B is width 2. Every function's symbol range is FULLY
code (no alignment padding truncates a range), and **no function
contains an out-of-function `c.j`**: each is self-contained, one entry,
no tail-call arrangement to model.

### What the decode says, for S3–S7

- **`isdirempty` IS INLINED** — no symbol in the image. Its body is
  sys_unlink's `readi` at +0x112 with the two panics at +0x136/+0x142
  ("isdirempty: readi" / the dirlookup one) and the loop back. S7 gets
  no separate contract; it is a block inside sys_unlink's WP.
- **filewrite carries the ONLY indirect call in the batch**: `c.jalr a5`
  at +0x7e, the `devsw[f->major].write(...)` dispatch. It is also the
  only function in the batch with TWO returns (`c.jr ra` at +0x108 and
  +0x124). S3 needs the device arm's dispatch shape, the same one
  fileread's proof already carries (its consoleread axiom).
- **Only filewrite and sys_unlink reach `panic`** (filewrite +0x11e;
  sys_unlink +0xf4, +0x136, +0x142) — those two thread the standing
  `panic_wp_any` obligation, the other eleven do not. **create calls no
  panic at all**, so its dirlink failures are ordinary error arms.
- **create's `ret` sits at +0x74**, only a quarter into a 312-byte body:
  the early-return path is hot and every cold arm is laid out after it.
  Same shape in sys_open (ret at +0xd0 of 342B, with `itrunc` at +0x150
  *after* the return) and sys_unlink (ret at +0x16e of 384B). Expect to
  prove these back-to-front, not top-to-bottom.
- create's 19 direct calls are the boss list: nameiparent, ilock×3,
  dirlookup, iunlockput×6, ialloc, iupdate×3, dirlink×4 (one for the
  entry, three for `.`/`..`/the parent link on the mkdir path).
- sys_exec's tail is `kexec` at +0xca (plus argaddr/argstr/memset/
  fetchaddr/kalloc/fetchstr/kfree×2) — its Code file lands now, its
  proof waits on the exec campaign as planned.
- Loop counts (backward branches/jumps): filewrite 5, create 6,
  sys_open 8, sys_unlink 6.

Mirror evidence: all 45 files compiled, exit 0, no `Error` in any log
(32 shards ~7 s each, 16-wide, 15 s wall; 13 Code files 3.4–10.8 s,
11 s wall). Eight sibling Code files across the changed shards
(CodeNamex, CodeReadi, CodeVirtioDiskRw, CodeKfork, CodePrintk,
CodeIreclaim, CodeUsertrap, CodeBalloc) recompiled exit 0 against the
new shards. `lemma_diff.py --ref HEAD`: 45 files, CLEAN.

## S2 — the dist=0 retrofit LANDED (inheritance items 2+3, and item 4's bonus)

Full write-up in `design/fs-icache.md` §15.2. Headlines:

- **The D1 kernel-arm verdict is EXACTNESS CONFIRMED.** either_copyin's
  kernel post is a bare `⌜r = 0⌝` (SpecEitherCopyin.either_copyin_post),
  so writei's committed-partial-chunk break at +0xb0 is unreachable for
  `user = false`. No other mechanism touches bytes above `off+tot`: the
  bmap-returns-0 break stops before any copy, and both framed exits pass
  `dist := 0%nat` literally. §15.1(i)'s ruling stands as written.
- SpecWritei gains ONE clause, `⌜user = false -> dist = 0%nat⌝`.
  SpecDirlink drops `dist`/`dstb` from its postcondition binder and its
  range clause is now two-way. SpecDirlink gains the linked-inum premise
  (unused by dirlink itself — `clear`ed with a comment).
- **`DirView.dir_ok_dirlink` is proved**, Closed under the global
  context. §15.1(i)'s obstacle is gone; S5's create can re-park.
- Gate: EXIT=0, **1021 vo**, zero `Error`. lemma_diff CLEAN over the 5
  changed files. Print Assumptions on `Writei.wp_writei_sconf` and
  `Dirlink.wp_dirlink_sconf`: 5 platform axioms + funext, each.

TRAP FOR LATER STAGES (new): the mirror's Code `.vo` from before S1's
shard edits are STALE and `make` will not notice — a `one.sh` on any
proof over a touched Code file dies with *"makes inconsistent
assumptions over library xv6iris.KernelDecodeNN"*. Run `full.sh` once
after a git-sync before iterating.

## The stage ladder

- **S1** (agent): the DECODE stage — 13 Code files (the 12 targets +
  CodeSysExec for the future) via tools/gen_code.py, FULL-generator-
  into-scratch recipe (durable-notes; never --only), manifest rows,
  all 32 shards, scratch-verified, near-full rebuild lands with it.
- **S2** (agent) **— LANDED**: the dist=0 retrofit — SpecWritei kernel
  arm + ProofWritei + SpecDirlink third-arm re-derivation + the
  linked-inum premise (items 2+3) + `DirView.dir_ok_dirlink`.
- **S3** (agent): filestat (stat_at + the hole + copyout) and
  filewrite (the loop over writei inside its own transaction;
  fd-type premise per item 5). file.c 7/7.
- **S4** (agent): sys_read/sys_write/sys_fstat — argfd + the file.c
  contracts; thin shells.
- **S5** (agent): create — the writing half's boss: namei/nameiparent
  + ialloc + ilock's third arm + dirlink (+ the "." and ".." links on
  the mkdir path) + the found-arm early exit. Its contract's
  found/created arms mirror dirlink's.
- **S6** (agent): sys_open (create arm + open-existing arm + the
  device checks + fdalloc/filealloc) + sys_mkdir + sys_mknod +
  sys_chdir (idup/iput of cwd — inode_held swap via proc_priv).
- **S7** (agent): sys_link + sys_unlink (nlink writei choreography,
  the record zeroing, isdirempty for unlink's dir arm — check decode:
  isdirempty may be a separate static fn or inlined).
- Final gate → coverage ~178/188 → EC2 SHUTDOWN (user-standing).

Per-stage discipline unchanged from fs-namei: coordinator designs and
merges, Opus agents prove in isolated worktrees against the EC2
mirror, specs frozen before proofs, park-green protocol, stop-and-
report on design surprises, lemma_diff + Print Assumptions gates,
NEVER scp _CoqProject, no coordinator gates while an agent is live.
The ~50 recorded traps live in projects/fs-namei.md's stage ledgers.
