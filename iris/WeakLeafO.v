(** * WeakLeafO.v — leaves with the [wstate] HIDDEN.

    Design: [`claude-notes/design/weak-memory-sc-parity.md`] §4 / obligation
    §5.2, done WITHOUT re-basing [wmstate_interp].

    THE RESIDUE THIS REMOVES.  [WeakGhost.hart_ws] is an EXACT-valued
    [ghost_var], so a leaf can only step it by naming both states — which
    is why every caller above a leaf carried an [ws] binder, an
    [⌜ws_le ws ws'⌝] and an [hart_ws] in and out.  [WeakGhost.hart_view]
    pairs that exact half with the monotone authority under one
    existential, so the value is hidden outside and still exactly known
    inside; [hart_view_close] consumes the [ws_le] the leaf hands back, and
    it never reaches the caller.

    NOTHING BELOW THIS FILE CHANGES.  [WeakGhost]'s interpretation, and all
    twenty existing [WeakLeaf*.v] files, are untouched; so are the ~48
    [hart_ws_update] call sites.  Every wrapper here is the underlying leaf
    plus [hart_view_open] / [hart_view_close].

    THE FRAME IS GONE, AND THAT IS THE POINT.  [WeakLeafM]'s leaves take
    the caller's other resources as [vwp_hold F ws] and hand back
    [vwp_hold F ws'].  That plumbing existed for ONE reason: a [vProp]
    frame is indexed by the hart's view, so when the leaf moved [ws] to
    [ws'] the frame had to be carried along to be re-indexed.

    An objective frame does not.  [WeakObj.wobj F] is an [iProp] whose only
    view-dependence is a PERSISTENT floor ([view_lb]), and floors only
    grow — so [wobj F] is still true after the step without anyone having
    touched it.  It therefore stays in the Iris context across the leaf,
    exactly as an SC caller's resources do, and the wrappers below
    instantiate [F := ⌜True⌝ ] and take no frame argument at all.

    A caller that wants to USE the frame (do a load out of it) converts at
    that point with [wobj_to_hold], which needs the authority inside
    [hart_view] — once, where the load is, not once per instruction. *)

  (** ** 1. THE GENERIC CONVERSION.

      Every ws-threading leaf in the tree has this shape once its curried
      resources are bundled into [Pre] / [Post] (check any of the twenty
      [WeakLeaf*.v] files: none of them mentions a [wstate] in [Pre] or
      [Post]).  So one lemma is the whole conversion, and the per-leaf
      sweep is bundling — mechanical, no new proof content.

      No frame appears: see the header.  [Pre] / [Post] are the leaf's own
      resources, and the caller's stay in its context. *)
  Lemma leaf_hide (Pre Post : iProp Σ) :
    (∀ ws : wstate,
        ⊢ Pre -∗ hart_ws cpu_id ws -∗
          (∀ ws' : wstate, ⌜ws_le ws ws'⌝ -∗ Post -∗ hart_ws cpu_id ws' -∗
             WWP Loop) -∗
          WWP Loop) ->
    Pre -∗ hart_view cpu_id -∗ (Post -∗ hart_view cpu_id -∗ WWP Loop) -∗
    WWP Loop.
  Proof.
    iIntros (Hleaf) "HPre [%ws [Hws Hauth]] Hcont".
    iApply (Hleaf ws with "HPre Hws").
    iIntros (ws') "%Hle HPost Hws".
    iMod (ws_update _ _ ws' with "Hauth") as "Hauth"; [exact Hle|].
    iApply ("Hcont" with "HPost"). iExists ws'. iFrame.
  Qed.

  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)
  (** ** 2. The worked leaf.

      Compare with [WeakLeafM.wwp_lui]: no [ws] parameter, no [∀ ws'], no
      [⌜ws_le ws ws'⌝], no frame in or out, and [hart_view cpu_id] in place
      of [hart_ws cpu_id ws] / [hart_ws cpu_id ws'].

      SO THE CALL SITE IS [WpMmodeUtype.wp_lui_gpr]'S PLUS EXACTLY ONE
      NAME.  Against [WkStartNew]'s instruction 35 as it stands today:

        SC     iApply (wp_lui_gpr … with "Hmm HpcfA Hpc Hfile Hi35").
               iIntros "Hmm HpcfA Hpc Hfile".
        NOW    iApply (wwp_lui … ws34 _ … with "… Hi35 Hhws Hstk").
               iIntros (ws35) "%Hwsle35 Hmm HpcfA Hpc Hfile Hhws Hstk".
        HERE   iApply (wwp_lui_o … with "Hmm HpcfA Hpc Hfile Hi35 Hhws").
               iIntros "Hmm HpcfA Hpc Hfile Hhws".

      [ws34], [%Hwsle35] and [Hstk] are gone.  [Hhws] is NOT, and cannot be
      removed at this altitude: it is the client half of an exclusive
      [ghost_var], so it has to be passed to whoever updates it.  Deleting
      it means moving the whole cell into [wmstate_interp] — see the
      worklist entry "the last name". *)
